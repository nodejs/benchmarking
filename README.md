# Benchmarking Work Group

## Mandate

The Benchmark working group's purpose is to gain consensus for an agreed set of benchmarks that can be used to:

1. Track and evangelize performance gains made between Node releases
2. Avoid performance regressions between releases

Its responsibilities are:

1. Identify 1 or more benchmarks that reflect customer usage.  Likely need more than one to cover typical Node use cases including low-latency and high concurrency
2. Work to get community consensus on the list chosen
3. Add regular execution of chosen benchmarks to Node builds
4. Track/publicize performance between builds/releases


The path forward is to:
 * Define the important
   [use cases](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/blob/master/docs/use_cases.md)
 * Define the key
   [runtime attributes](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/blob/master/docs/runtime_attributes.md)
 * Find/create benchmarks that provide good coverage for the
   use cases and attributes
   ([current table](https://github.com/nodejs/benchmarking/blob/master/docs/use_cases.md))
